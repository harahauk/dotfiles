# `.Dotfiles` for Harald Hauknes
Might be my oldest living versioned "code". Some of this is from my SVN-days.  
I use this to document my settings in programs that have sensible ways of configuring themselves.

**Disclaimer**: I do not take any responsibility if your `vim` eats your cookies. Use with caution.
Feel free to point out any insanity to me, I appreciate pointers.

## TODO
There is a lot of #TODO-tags, this is for my own reference to do more research on the settings I use in daily operations.
